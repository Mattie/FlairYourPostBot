# FlairYourPostBot

A reddit bot to remind users to flair their post created by /u/kooldawgstar on reddit. Reworked a bit by /u/thorax.

#Features

1) Posts are now removed after N minutes and a reply is made to flair their post.

2) If post is flaired within M minutes post will be approved, but if it is not flaired within 10 minutes the original reply will be edited to inform them the removal is permanent.

Used by [/u/FlairHelperBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/FlairHelperBot) (cousin of the /u/FlairYourPostBot).

#How to Install

Invite /u/FlairHelperBot to your subreddit with the posts permissions and then once the invite is accepted the bot is operational. For more information PM [/u/thorax](https://www.reddit.com/u/thorax/)
